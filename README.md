**This is not a development-ready language system. cavy-python is a prototype for
experimenting with language ideas that will eventually make it into Cavy 1.0.
See [cavy-rs](https://github.com/mcncm/cavy-rs) for what will eventually become
the "release" version. This repository is also not to be confused with [pycavy](https://github.com/mcncm/pycavy), a python package providing bindings to the cavy-rs compiler.**
